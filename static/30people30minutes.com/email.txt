The big day is upon us!!

Greetings, awesome people who are helping me celebrate my 30th!

Plans have finally been finalized, people confirmed, and locations set.  You now have an official time slot, and location. Info's on the website, and at the bottom of this very message.

Each one of you is critical tomorrow, so if anything comes up, please let me know!  You should be able to reach me via phone or text at (607) 262-0880.   Also, if a time slot or location can't work for you, please let me know ASAP so I can shuffle things around.  I think this should work with everyone's times though!

I'm excited for tomorrow, and to get to spend a slice of my decade-odometeter-turning with each of you.

See you tomorrow!
-Steven
