Come help me celebrate my 30th birthday!

That's right, I'm Steven, and I'm turning 30.  And I want YOU to come help me ring it in style.  How?  Well, I've decided to spend my birthday by talking to 30 people for 30 minutes each.  People just like you. 

I'm looking to talk to a wide range of you, across all ages, and from all walks of life.  So, if you're the sort of person who's game for 30 minutes of random conversation, and thinks this is indeed an awesome idea, let me know!  I want to talk to you.

The big day is this Friday, April 9th.

How to join in?  Well, drop me an email, with your name, at least one interesting fact about your self, and time blocks between 9am and midnight you're free.  Mentioning the general area within PDX that you'll be would also be useful for planning!

There's also a website, with all the info, and open time blocks (roughly.)
http://www.30people30minutes.com/

I've got about ten slots left, so on the odd chance that my inbox is flooded with responses, some folks may not be able to be fit in.  I'll also choose on a combination of awesomeness of email and closeness to where I'll already be for a given time-period.

And whether we get to talk or not, thanks so much for helping me bring in a new decade in epic style!

-Steven



So, I'm spending the day talking to 30 random people. 

In your 20's and want to know what the big 3-0 feels like?

In your 40's and want to let me know that 30's not a big deal?

In your 80's, and want to tell me about life, the universe everything?

Come tell me!  The date is April 9, 2010.

I'll be at several caf√©s, restaurants, and parks around Portland.

If you're interested, drop me an email, and claim a time block!

Oh, there's also this website. 

To 30!

Steven
