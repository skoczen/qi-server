<h1>30 People. 30 Minutes.</h1>
<h2>30 for 30 is done!</h2>
<p>It was a resounding success.  Thank you to each and every one of the participants (and those I couldn't squeeze in) for taking time out of your days to share 30 minutes with me.  It was hilarious, enlightening, exhausting, and deeply satisfying.  Thank you.</p>

<p>A few people have asked for pictures and stories.  So, in attempt to provide a bit of both, here's a quick runthrough of some memories and photos from the day!</p>

<h2>Memories.  Or, things I never expected to learn.</h2>
<p>To begin, I asked everyone their favorite number between 1 and 100, to see what I'd find.  I learned that there are very few patterns.  Birthdays are one, easy divisibility (12, 20, 64) is another.  </p>
Some other notable numbers?
<ul>
<li>e
<li>57
<li>(After careful deliberation) "I am really indifferent to numbers."
<li>8
</ul>

The rest of the fifteen hours of conversation varied widely.  Some folks shared with me their passions, or bits of their lives.  Everyone taught me something new and told me about themselves in ways they might not even have known.   I'm lucky to know each of you.  Here's some highlights from the day!
<ul>
<li>hugged the world's smallest park
<li>talked with a friend 4,226 miles away in Grenada
<li>learned about the difference between veterinary programs
<li>wondered what it is about the midwest that draws people from there to one of Portland's best non-profits
<li>discovered several Portlanders' passions for ping-pong
<li>rode in the the world's coolest drivable home
<li>found out that you really, really don't ever want to live in Reno
<li>listened my way bus-hopping through Thailand and Laos
<li>watched a friend light up with a passion for history
<li>crossed my fingers for an interview at West Point
<li>had tea with three generations of a family
<li>watched a friend contemplating the next steps in his career
<li>discovered a hidden talent for trampolining
<li>heard the most passionate argument of my life for better science teaching from a friend who will remake how it's done
<li>scratched the surface of the poetic form
<li>learned that pelting howling cats with eggs doesn't help
<li>attended a memory of the world junior volleyball olympics. (Go # 12!)
<li>wondered about the unexplained influence of fifty-seven
<li>learned about modern playwrights, and the place of theatre in the future
<li>discussed the trials and travails of drawing blood, sometimes whilst traveling south america.
<li>found out the history of African-Americans in Portland
<li>noted that Bombay Chaat House, not India Chaat House is the one you want
<li>learned about the super-power of synesthesia
<li>listened to musings about modern dance
<li>celebrated 12 years of friendship with my best friend
<li>listened to the journey of the former editor of Oprah's book club
<li>looked at the future of a great company
<li>meditated with two medicine balls marked "3" and "0"
<li>found out that jail sometimes isn't as hard as you think
<li>got some damn good advice about relationships
<li>searched through childhood memories of Washington forests for the magic of chanterelle mushrooms
<li>had a sign made for me!  (Thanks face!)
<li>discussed how one must attend weddings and funerals
<li>journeyed from Portland, OR to Boston, MA on a tandem bike
<li>realized that Pres. Obama is, in fact, just that smart
<li>found a kindred southwestern soul trying to put roots down in the soggy northwest
<li>discovered a poet's passion for flash fiction
<li>met with my #1 (yes, you) participant!
<li>told a story of F-16s 
<li>enjoyed a Sacsayhuaman cocktail
<li>heard stories of skiing down stairs
<li>learned about a family cookbook built by every member and every generation
<li>reminisced over the brilliance of Douglas Adams
<li>saw the power of the zoetrope forums
<li>learned the ins and outs of a major engineering firm as it turns itself green
<li>was exposed to the world of train-hopping
<li>discovered the wonder of good espresso over vanilla gelato
<li>went home, 30, the luckiest man in the world.
</ul>
Thank you all again.

<h2>Pictures!</h2>
<p>I'd originally planned to take a picture with each person I talked with, but my poor memory quickly sent this plan by the wayside.  But, here are a few sporadic pictures throughout the day!</p>

<h2>The Original Story:  Or, how I'm turning thirty years old.</h2>
<div id="logo"></div>

<p>Yes, it's true.  I'm Steven Skoczen, and on <b>Friday April 9, 2010</b>, I'm indeed turning 30 years old.  And, since I'm not really the mope-about-getting-older type, I've decided to celebrate my thirtieth birthday by talking to thirty different people for thirty minutes each.  I'm looking to put together a mix of people I know well, people I don't know as well as I'd like, and people I've never met in my life.  We'll meet up in venues around Portland, and in a few cases, via the interwebs.</p>

<h2>Interested in spending half an hour talking with me?</h2>
<p>Awesome. That makes two of us!  Please drop me an email at <a href="mailto:steven@skoczen.net">steven@skoczen.net</a>, with the following:
	<ol>
		<li>your name,</li>
		<li>time ranges that work well for you, and</li>
		<li>either the areas of Portland that work for you (if you're in PDX), or the communication technologies I can use to reach you (if you're not.)</li>
	</ol>
If you're already on the list below, please just let me know the times that work for your schedule!<br/><br/>
More details will be forthcoming, and people who are meeting up will get emails before this shindig goes down.  I'll also post a recap and pictures once I'm 30.  But for now, onto the list!</p>
